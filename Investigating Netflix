Executive Summary:
This analysis delves into the trend of movie durations over time, with a focus on Netflix's movie database, to see if movies are indeed getting shorter. The results, visualized through a scatter plot, reveal no clear trend of decreasing movie lengths over the years. While shorter movies (under 60 minutes) do exist, they are not predominant in the dataset. This suggests that despite the presence of brief films, there isn't a significant shift towards shorter movie durations overall.


Objective
Identify What may be contributing to movies getting shorter over time. (Netflix Case)

The Code:
# Importing pandas and matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in the Netflix CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

# Subset the DataFrame for type "Movie"
netflix_subset = netflix_df[netflix_df["type"] == "Movie"]

# Select only the columns of interest
netflix_movies = netflix_subset[["title", "country", "genre", "release_year", "duration"]]

# Filter for durations shorter than 60 minutes
short_movies = netflix_movies[netflix_movies.duration < 60]

# Define an empty list
colors = []

# Iterate over rows of netflix_movies
for label, row in netflix_movies.iterrows() :
    if row["genre"] == "Children" :
        colors.append("red")
    elif row["genre"] == "Documentaries" :
        colors.append("blue")
    elif row["genre"] == "Stand-Up":
        colors.append("green")
    else:
        colors.append("black")
        
# Inspect the first 10 values in your list        
colors[:10]

# Set the figure style and initalize a new figure
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

# Create a scatter plot of duration versus release_year
plt.scatter(netflix_movies.release_year, netflix_movies.duration, c=colors)

# Create a title and axis labels
plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")
plt.xlabel("Release year")
plt.ylabel("Duration (min)")

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Are we certain that movies are getting shorter?
answer = "no"
